```r
## Read the data
data <- read.csv("wisc_bc_data.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

## View data dimension
dim(data)

## View data structure
str(data)

## Check missing data
sum(is.na(data))

# Load package & pre-process data
library(tidyverse)
data <- select(data, -1) %>%

## Use stratified sampling
install.packages("sampling")
library(sampling)

## Data partitioning, 70% training; 30% testing
train_id <- strata(data, 'diagnosis', size = rev(round(table(data$diagnosis) * 0.7)))$ID_unit

test_data <- data[-train_id, ]

## Data modeling
install.packages("caret")

## Model prediction
